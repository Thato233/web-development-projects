       <h1>Characteristics of water</h1>

       <p>It is a tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless liquid at room temperature and pressure.<br>
        It has a high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, which means it can absorb and release a lot of heat without changing its temperature or state.
        It is a polar molecule, which means it has partial positive and negative charges on its atoms, and a bent structure.
        It is an excellent solvent, which means it can dissolve many polar and ionic substances.
        It has cohesive and adhesive properties, which means it can stick to itself and to other surfaces.
        It is less dense as a solid than as a liquid, which means ice floats on water</p>
